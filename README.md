JSP: This is in progress, although you can compile `bin/network_tool` and `bin/processor_tool_risp`,
and run `scripts/test_risp.sh` to make sure that everything is working.
I'm shoring up the documentation, and it will be ready for prime time.

# What This Repo Contains

This repo will contain the following:

- Spiking neural network format definition
- Code for creating and manipulating networks in the network format
- Processor interface
- Simulator for the RISP neuroprocessor
- `network_tool`: A command-line tool for creating and manipulating networks
- `processor_tool_risp`: Command-line tool for simulating the RISP neuroprocessor running networks

It will be complete by October 31, 2024 (hopefully sooner).
