# The Bars and Stripes problem, and a RISP solution

This problem comes from the paper "An FPGA-Based Neuromorphic Processor with All-to-All
Connectivity" [Maheshwari23].  You are given an input of *r x c$ black or white pixels,
and you wnat to determine whether the input has at least one vertical bar or horizontal
stripe.  Here are four examples:
